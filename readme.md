## KNIGHTS TRAVAILS

TASK:

To build a function 'knightMoves' that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

Use a search algorithm [Chose the Breadth First Search] to find the shortest path between the starting square and the ending square.

# Additional Feature

On a chess-board, this app allows the user to select a starting square and an ending square.
Once selected, the app takes over and displays the numbers of the squares encountered on the way and the total number of moves required on the shortest path to the ending square.
The display also shows Odin moving from the starting square while stopping at each square on its way to the end square.
